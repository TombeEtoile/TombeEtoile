👋 Hi, I’m @TombeEtoile (Augustin VERDIER)
I've just finished a year's training at OpenClassRooms and am now a “Python Developer”.
I've also been an SEO consultant for 2 years (1 year in an agency and 1 year freelance).
Why did you spend a year learning Python? To automate processes and create lots of scripts !

Did you ask for my passions ? 
- climbing
- rock climbing
- rock climbing
(skiing, mountaineering, longboarding too)
